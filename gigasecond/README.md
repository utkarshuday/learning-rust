# Gigasecond

Your task is to determine the date and time one gigasecond after a certain date.

A gigasecond is one thousand million seconds. That is a one with nine zeros after it.

If you were born on `January 24th, 2015 at 22:00 (10:00:00pm)`, then you would be a gigasecond old on `October 2nd, 2046 at 23:46:40 (11:46:40pm)`.

If you're unsure what operations you can perform on `PrimitiveDateTime` take a look at the time crate which is listed as a dependency in the `Cargo.toml` file for this exercise.
